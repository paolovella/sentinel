# Security Review

This document describes the security review process and findings for the
Vellaveto project, satisfying the OpenSSF Best Practices `security_review`
criterion.

## Scope

The review covers all Rust crates in the workspace (18 crates), all SDK
implementations (Python, TypeScript, Go, Java), the admin console (React SPA),
Terraform provider, VS Code extension, Helm chart, and CI/CD infrastructure.

## Methodology

### Automated Adversarial Auditing (Swarm Protocol)

Vellaveto uses a multi-agent adversarial audit system. Over 270
audit rounds (including the R259-R270 campaign of March 2026), dedicated
adversarial agents systematically attack the codebase using a structured
methodology:

1. **Static analysis** — Code review for OWASP Top 10, CWE patterns, and
   Rust-specific anti-patterns (unwrap, panic, fail-open defaults)
2. **Threat modeling** — Attack chain analysis against the MCP threat model,
   including tool squatting, rug-pull, injection, exfiltration, and supply chain
3. **Fuzzing** — 24 fuzz targets covering parsers, validators, and security
   boundaries (injection, path normalization, domain extraction, DLP, policy
   compilation)
4. **Formal verification** — 882+ verification instances across Verus,
   Kani, TLA+, Coq, Lean 4, and Alloy: Verus (668 verified items on actual
   Rust, ALL inputs via Z3 SMT), Kani (108 CBMC proof harnesses on
   actual Rust), TLA+ (14 specs: policy engine, ABAC, workflow, task
   lifecycle, cascading failure, credential vault, audit chain, capability
   delegation), Coq (45 theorems), Lean 4 (37 theorems), Alloy (10 assertions)

### Threat Intelligence Integration

Starting at R226, each audit round includes a threat intelligence sweep
analyzing 100+ attack vectors and 30+ CVEs from published research. Defenses
include FlipAttack reversal detection, Full-Schema Poisoning coverage, emoji
smuggling, Unicode confusable smuggling, MCP-ITP tool poisoning, Policy
Puppetry injection, and SANDWORM supply chain worm hardening.

## Findings Summary

| Total audit rounds | 254 |
| Total findings | 1,720+ |
| Findings resolved | 100% |
| CRITICAL findings | ~40 |
| HIGH findings | ~200 |
| MEDIUM findings | ~600 |

| False positives identified | ~200 |

### Severity Breakdown by Category

| Category | Findings |
|----------|----------|

| SSRF / DNS rebinding | ~40 |
| Authentication bypass | ~25 |
| Authorization / fail-open | ~80 |
| Information disclosure | ~60 |
| Supply chain | ~30 |
| Denial of service | ~50 |
| Cryptographic | ~20 |
| Transport parity gaps | ~70 |
| Input validation | ~150 |
| Other | ~875 |

## Key Security Properties Verified

- **Fail-closed**: All error paths, missing policies, lock poisoning, and
  capacity exhaustion produce Deny verdicts
- **No panics**: Zero `unwrap()` or `expect()` in library code (CI-enforced)
- **Tamper-evident audit**: SHA-256 hash chain + Ed25519 signed checkpoints
- **Zero unsafe**: No `unsafe` blocks in library code
- **Overflow protection**: `overflow-checks = true` in release profile,
  `saturating_add` on all security counters
- **Input validation**: `deny_unknown_fields` on all deserialized structs,
  bounded collections with `MAX_*` constants, control character rejection
- **Transport parity**: All security checks present across HTTP, WebSocket,
  gRPC, stdio, and SSE transports

## Additional Assurance

- **24 fuzz targets** covering all security-critical parsers
- **10,990+ Rust unit and integration tests** with adversarial test cases
- **Formal proofs** in 6 verification frameworks (Verus, TLA+, Alloy, Kani, Lean 4, Coq)
- **Supply chain**: cargo-vet audits, cargo-deny license/advisory checks,
  GitHub Actions pinned to SHA, SLSA provenance, SBOM generation
- **OpenSSF Scorecard**: Automated security posture assessment

## Limitations and Future Work

- All reviews to date are internal (automated adversarial agent + maintainer).
  An independent third-party penetration test is planned.
- Fuzz campaigns are currently limited to 30-second runs in CI. Extended
  campaigns (24h+) are run periodically but not on every commit.
- Formal verification covers core policy engine properties but does not yet
  cover the full MCP proxy pipeline.

## R259-R270 Adversarial Audit Campaign (March 2026)

12-round swarm adversarial audit targeting the full project. Results:
- **35 security findings fixed** (9 HIGH, 14 MEDIUM, 7 LOW, 5 documentation)
- **11 architectural hardening changes** (see docs/HARDENING.md for details)
- **4 new Verus kernels** (DRIFT-1–4, REVOKE-1–4, EVIDENCE-SIGN-1–3, WARM-1–3)
- **8 new Kani harnesses** (K133-K140)
- **36 new SDK tests** across Python, TypeScript, Go, Java
- **5 multi-step attack chains tested** (all blocked by existing defenses)
- **Supply chain audit**: zero CVEs, zero git dependencies, all registries verified
- **11,574 Rust tests, 556+ SDK tests, 59 admin console tests, 0 failures**
